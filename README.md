# etch-a-sketch
This is a project I undertook as part of the Project Odin Web Dev course. I tried to make the code as consice as possible, alltogether there's 36 lines of JavaScript inclusive of whitespace. 

Hovering the mouse over squares changes their colour, and a slider can be used to change the grid size.
